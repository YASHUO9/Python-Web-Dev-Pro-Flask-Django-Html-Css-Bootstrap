- Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites and web 
  applications. It provides a collection of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components that can be 
  easily customized and integrated into your projects. With Bootstrap, you can quickly create visually 
  appealing and consistent layouts across different devices and screen sizes. It simplifies the development 
  process by offering ready-to-use components like buttons, forms, navigation bars, and grids, saving you 
  time and effort. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Bootstrap offers a powerful 
  toolkit to enhance your web development workflow.
