#Flask:
#Flask is a web framework. It is a Python module that lets you develop web applications easily.
#Flask is a micro-framework. It does not require particular tools or libraries.
#It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.
#However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself.
