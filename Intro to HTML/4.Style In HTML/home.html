        In the velvet cloak of night, they gleam,
        Stitching dreams with a celestial seam,
        Each a diamond in the vast expanse,
        A twinkling tale of cosmic dance.
        
        Up above, where the heavens meet,
        Stars ignite with an ethereal heat,
        Painting patterns in the endless sky,
        Guiding wanderers as they pass by.
        
        Some shine bright, bold and grand,
        Like beacons in the dark they stand,
        Others whisper in a soft, faint hue,
        A subtle magic, a secret view.
        
        Oh, starry wonders, distant and true,
        What mysteries hide within your hue?
        Do you hold the secrets of the universe,
        Or are you simply there to disperse?
        
        A billion stories in your light,
        Each flicker a moment, burning bright,
        From ancient myths to futures unknown,
        You weave a tapestry all your own.
        
        So here's to you, celestial art,
        Captivating minds and stealing hearts,
        In your brilliance, we find our dreams,
        Forever bound to your silent schemes.</pre>
